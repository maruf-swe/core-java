@@ Class:::
Definition: A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
         It defines the structure (fields/variables) and behavior (methods/functions) that the objects of the class will have.
Purpose: To represent a real-world entity or concept that can be instantiated to create objects.

class declarations can include these components in order:
    Modifiers: A class can be public or have default access (Refer to this for details).
    Class name: The class name should begin with the initial letter capitalized by convention.
    Body: The class body is surrounded by braces, { }.

@@ Object:::
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has state (attributes) and behavior (methods) as defined by its class.
Purpose: To represent specific instances of a class with unique values for its attributes, while still adhering to the behavior defined by its class.

An object mainly consists of:
    State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.
    Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.
    Identity: It is a unique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.
    Method: A method is a collection of statements that perform some specific task and return the result to the caller

   ****  OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
            OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It is designed to promote
                     modularity, reusability, and organization of code.

  4 Pillars of Java OOPs Concepts

1. Encapsulation
   Definition:  Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on that data
     within a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to some of the objectâ€™s components using access
        modifiers like private and providing controlled access through getters and setters.
Purpose: To protect the internal state of an object from unauthorized access and modification.

2. Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class.
    The class that inherits is called the subclass, and the class being inherited from is the superclass.
Purpose: To promote code reuse and create a hierarchical relationship between classes.

3. Polymorphism
Definition: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it is typically achieved
      through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
Purpose: To allow objects to behave differently based on their actual class, even when they are treated as objects of a common superclass.

4. Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary features.
     This can be achieved through abstract classes or interfaces.
Purpose: To provide a simplified view of the system and reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
