    /*
    In Java, a package is a namespace used to organize classes and interfaces. Packages help avoid name conflicts and make
          it easier to locate and use classes, interfaces, and sub-packages.

Types of Packages
Built-in Packages: Java provides a rich set of built-in packages in the Java API (Application Programming Interface).
    These include packages such as:

java.lang - Contains fundamental classes like String, Math, Object, etc.
java.util - Contains utility classes like collections (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap), date/time handling, etc.
java.io - Provides classes for input/output operations, such as File, BufferedReader, FileInputStream, etc.
java.net - Contains classes for networking like URL, Socket, etc.
java.sql - Provides classes for database handling, such as Connection, Statement, etc.
User-defined Packages: These are packages that developers create to organize their classes logically.




Benefits of Using Packages:

Organizes Code: Packages allow for a logical grouping of related classes, making the codebase easier to navigate.
Avoids Name Conflicts: Different packages can contain classes with the same name, as long as they are in different namespaces.
Access Control: Packages help with controlling the visibility and access levels of classes and members. For example,
     classes in the same package can access each otherâ€™s package-private members.
