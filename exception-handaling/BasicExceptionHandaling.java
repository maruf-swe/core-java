        1. What is an Exception?
        An exception is an event that disrupts the normal flow of a program's instructions. It can be caused by various factors, such as incorrect user input, hardware failure, or programming bugs.

        2. Types of Exceptions:
        Checked Exceptions: Exceptions that are checked at compile-time. The compiler ensures these exceptions are either caught or declared in the method signature.
                Example: IOException, SQLException
        Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions that occur at runtime, and are not checked by the compiler. These are typically caused by programming bugs.
                Example: NullPointerException, ArithmeticException
        Errors: These are not exceptions, but serious issues that typically canâ€™t be recovered from. They are subclasses of java.lang.Error.
                Example: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError
