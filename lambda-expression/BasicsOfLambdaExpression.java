        A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are
                 similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

              Basic Syntax:::::
         (parameters) -> expression
         parameters: List of parameters for the method.
         ->: Lambda operator.
         expression: Single expression or block of code.


         There are three Lambda Expression Parameters are mentioned below:::
                        Zero Parameter
                        Single Parameter
                        Multiple Parameters


         Functionalities of Lambda Expression::::
    Lambda Expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces lambda expressions are
          added in Java 8 and provide the below functionalities.

    Functional Interfaces: A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method.
    Code as Data: Treat functionality as a method argument.
    Class Independence: Create functions without defining a class.
    Pass and Execute: Pass lambda expressions as objects and execute on demand.
