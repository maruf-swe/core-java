@@ Class:::
Definition: A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure (fields/variables) and behavior (methods/functions) that the objects of the class will have.
Purpose: To represent a real-world entity or concept that can be instantiated to create objects.

@@ Object:::
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has state (attributes) and behavior (methods) as defined by its class.
Purpose: To represent specific instances of a class with unique values for its attributes, while still adhering to the behavior defined by its class.


   ****  Basics of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
            OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It is designed to promote
                     modularity, reusability, and organization of code. The core principles of OOP are:

1. Encapsulation
   Definition:  Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (variables) and methods that operate on that data
     within a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to some of the objectâ€™s components using access
        modifiers like private and providing controlled access through getters and setters.
Purpose: To protect the internal state of an object from unauthorized access and modification.

2. Inheritance
Definition: Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class.
    The class that inherits is called the subclass, and the class being inherited from is the superclass.
Purpose: To promote code reuse and create a hierarchical relationship between classes.

3. Polymorphism
Definition: Polymorphism means the ability of an object to take on many forms. In Java, it is typically achieved
      through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).
Purpose: To allow objects to behave differently based on their actual class, even when they are treated as objects of a common superclass.

4. Abstraction
Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary features.
     This can be achieved through abstract classes or interfaces.
Purpose: To provide a simplified view of the system and reduce complexity by hiding unnecessary details.
