/*
    In Java, access modifiers determine the visibility or accessibility of classes, methods, variables, and constructors.
      They are essential for controlling how data and functionality are accessed and used in object-oriented programming (OOP).
        There are four primary access modifiers in Java:

        1. Public Access Modifier (public)
        2. Private Access Modifier (private)
        3. Protected Access Modifier (protected)
        4. Default Access Modifier (Package-Private)


    Use private for variables only accessible within the class.
    Use protected for variables accessible within the class and its subclasses.
    Use public for variables accessible from anywhere.
    Use Default Access Modifier Within the Same Package


    **Package-private (default) means that the variable is accessible only within the same package.
It is not accessible from classes in other packages, even if they are subclasses.
This is the default access level when no modifier is provided.
