                            What is Abstraction in Java?
Abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and showing only the essential
   features of an object or system. It allows us to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

In simple terms, abstraction provides a simplified view of a complex system by showing only relevant details and hiding the unnecessary ones.

                        Key Points of Abstraction:
Simplifies Complex Systems: Only the important details are visible, making it easier to understand and use objects.
Improves Code Reusability and Maintainability: By hiding complex implementation details, code can be more reusable and easier to maintain.
Helps Achieve Loose Coupling: Abstraction decouples the code, which makes it flexible and easier to modify.

                        How to Achieve Abstraction in Java?
            Java provides two main ways to achieve abstraction:::

    1. Abstract Classes
    2. Interfaces

                                Advantages of Abstraction::
Hides Complexity: Users donâ€™t need to know the details of the implementation. They only need to interact with the interface
                       or abstract class, focusing on high-level functionalities.

Code Reusability: Abstract methods and concrete methods in abstract classes can be reused across different subclasses.

Loose Coupling: Abstraction helps reduce the coupling between classes, making the code more flexible and easier to modify.

Ease of Maintenance: Since only relevant details are exposed, maintaining and modifying the code becomes easier.

Better Organization: Using abstraction organizes code by defining common behaviors in abstract classes or interfaces,
                        and then extending or implementing them in concrete classes.
