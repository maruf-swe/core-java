Abstraction in Java is the concept of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features to the user.
  It simplifies complex systems by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. For example, a television
    remote control provides simple buttons for interaction while hiding the complex internal workings of the TV.

Hereâ€™s a concise,  explanation of **Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods**:
1. **Abstract Class**: A class declared with the `abstract` keyword.
2. **Abstract Method**: A method without an implementation, declared in an abstract class.
3. **Concrete Methods**: An abstract class can have concrete (fully implemented) methods along with abstract methods.
4. **Overriding**: Abstract methods must be overridden in subclasses, or the subclass must be abstract itself.
5. **Instantiation**: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly with the `new` operator.
6. **Abstract Class with Constructor**: An abstract class can have parameterized constructors. A default constructor is also present.
