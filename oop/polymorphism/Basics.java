The word ‘polymorphism’ means ‘having many forms’. In Java, polymorphism refers to the ability of a message to be displayed
in more than one form. This concept is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming and it allows objects to behave differently
 based on their specific class type.

Real-life Illustration of Polymorphism in Java: A person can have different characteristics at the same time. Like a man at
the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behaviors in different situations.
 This is called polymorphism.

                Types of Polymorphism::
       1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Static Polymorphism):: Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the method to be
                 executed is determined at compile time. The most common example is method overloading.

       2. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Polymorphism):: Runtime polymorphism occurs when the method to be executed is
                              determined at runtime. This is achieved through method overriding.


        Advantages of Polymorphism::
* Increases code reusability by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class.
* Improves readability and maintainability of code by reducing the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained.
* Supports dynamic binding, enabling the correct method to be called at runtime, based on the actual class of the object.
* Enables objects to be treated as a single type, making it easier to write generic code that can handle objects of different types.
