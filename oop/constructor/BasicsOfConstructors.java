        A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It is called automatically when an object of a class is created,
        and it sets initial values for object attributes.BasicsOfConstructors are similar to methods but are specifically designed to allocate
          and initialize memory for objects when the new keyword is used.

           Note:  It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class. It is because the java compiler creates a
              default constructor (constructor with no arguments) if your class doesnâ€™t have any.


          Types of BasicsOfConstructors in Java::
            Default Constructor
            Parameterized Constructor
            Copy Constructor

  Default Constructor: A default constructor has no parameters and is provided by the compiler if no constructor is defined.
      Writing a no-argument constructor or parameterized constructor replaces the compiler-generated default constructor.
  Parameterized Constructor: A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
            If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.
  Copy Constructor:
